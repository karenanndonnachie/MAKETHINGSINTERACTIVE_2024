# PUSH-BUTTON LED
## Strictly speaking this isn't a true Arduino circuit, as it doesn't use the Arduino as a micro-controller, but just as a power source.
But! we have to start somewhere, right?

### Components
<ul><li>Breadboard</li><li>4 jumper wires</li><li>1 LED (red or Yellow or blue or green)</li><li>1 resistor 220Ω </li><li>1 Push-button or momentary switch</li><li>3.3V Powersource (2 * AA batteries or 3.3V from Arduino)</li></ul>

The description of the breadboard is the following: 
+ve 3.3V --> 220Ω resistor --> push-button side A | push-button side B --> LED Cathode (long leg) | LED Anode (short leg) --> GND (ground)

### Code
N/a (no code required, Arduino is merely a voltage regulator in this circuit, in fact it can run from a battery.
