# PUSH-BUTTON LED
## Strictly speaking this isn't a true Arduino circuit, as it doesn't use the Arduino as a micro-controller, but just as a power source.
But! we have to start somewhere, right?

The description of teh breadboard is the following: 
+ve 3.3V --> 220Î© resistor --> push-button side A | push-button side B --> LED Cathode (long leg) | LED Anode (short leg) --> GND (ground)

### Code
N/a (no code required, Arduino is merely a voltage regulator in this circuit, in fact it can run from a battery.
