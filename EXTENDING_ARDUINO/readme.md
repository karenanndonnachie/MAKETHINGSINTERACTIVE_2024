ARDUINO + SENSORS	arduino firmata [or how to use sensors inside Processing] Arduino + Processing. The easiest way to make Arduino and processing talk is via Firmata. Firmata is a program that runs on Arduino and allows you to control it from Processing. Basically, you'll upload Firmata on your board once then you can close the Arduino app (the IDE) and then simply work from Processing.	 |
