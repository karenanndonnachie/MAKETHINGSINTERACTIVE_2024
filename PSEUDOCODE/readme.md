# Pseudocode
## Wot?
Pseudocode is an informal high-level description of the operating principle of a computer program or other algorithm.

Pseudocode is a fundamental part of any code dev project. 
Before you build or code anything, draw a sketch and annotate for code: 
ie. write out in plain [human readable] language all the steps, triggers, actions and assumptions. 

- Start with INPUTs, List all the buttons or switches or other information your sensors may be gathering, and give each value a name. 
These will be your INPUT VARIABLES. 
- Then write out what that data /action/input may 'trigger', ie. what happens when the button is pressed or your heartrate goes up? 
This is your OUTPUT. 
- Lastly write the PROCESS, this will involve 'if.. then' or some calculations or 'translations' (which we called mapping) of the data, to make it fit the range of values your OUTPUTS can respond to.

Remember that Designing your program with Pseudo code is quite subjective and nonstandard. 
It uses the structural conventions of a normal programming language, but is intended for human reading rather than machine reading, hence program design & prototyping.

There is no set syntax that you absolutely must use for pseudocode, but it is a common professional courtesy to use standard pseudocode structures that other programmers can easily understand.

If you are coding a project by yourself, then the most important thing is that the pseudocode helps you structure your thoughts and enact your plan.

If you are working with others on a project—whether they are other designers, programmers/developers, clients, or non-technical collaborators—it is important to use at least some standard structures so that everyone else can easily understand your intent.

Clarity is a primary goal of using Pseudocode in your program/app/project deveopment, and it may help if you work within accepted programming conventions.

As you develop your program from Pseudocode into actual code, you will need to transcribe it into a programming language (maybe Python or C++/Arduino, or Javascript)– so it can help to sometimes use the syntax of the destination language.

### Hot tip: 
- use short sentences and new line for each sub-step, try to group into 'functions' where possible
- Watch out for assumptions, the Arduino won't know what 'hot' or 'cold' is, or try to add specific values where you can
- Find a balance between function and cretivity in your variable naming, but be consistent
