# Capacitive touch 
## Capacitive touch or touch control is very easy to build.
Essentially you are using the human body or a banana or a leaf or a piece of playdoh to close a circuit.
The 'makey-makey' project works off exactly this concept.
in this folder you will find a couple of different ways to build a touch circuit. in each case the circuit will work when you hold the ground in one hand and the other wire in the other. or you hold the ground and touch a banana that is connected to the wire.

This is the build that goes with the .ino code in this folder
