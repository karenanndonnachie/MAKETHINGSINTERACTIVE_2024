# Capacitive touch (& Voltage dividers below )
## Capacitive touch or touch control is very easy to build.
Essentially you are using teh human body or a banana or a leaf or a piece of playdoh to close a circuit.
The makey-makey project works off exactly this concept.
in this folder you will find a couple of different ways to build a touch circuit. in each case teh circuit will work when you hold the ground in one hand and the other wire in the other. or you hold the ground and touch a banana that is connected to teh wire.
